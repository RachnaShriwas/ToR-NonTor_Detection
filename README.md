# ToR-NonTor_Detection
Tor-NonTor Traffic Detection Using Deep Learning

This repo is to share the code shared during this [TechGig webinar](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-deep-learning-cybersecurity-satnam-singh/) and also referred in this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-deep-learning-cybersecurity-satnam-singh/). We have used (Balamurali and Satnam) a dataset taken from [Canadian Institute of CyberSecurity](http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/tor.html).  We cannot share the data here; please contact a.habibi.l@unb.ca.to obtain the dataset.
